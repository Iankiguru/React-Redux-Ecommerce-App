This E-commerce app is built using various frontend and backend technologies. The frontend uses React for building the user interface and state management, as well as React Router DOM for handling client-side routing. Additionally, the app employs Material-UI for styling components and Formik and Yup for form validation. Stripe JS is used for payment processing, while the Emotion library provides CSS-in-JS functionality.

On the other hand, the backend is built using Strapi, a headless CMS. It uses plugins for internationalization and user permissions, and Better SQLite for database management. Stripe is also used on the server-side for payment processing.

Overall, this app is designed to provide a user-friendly e-commerce experience with secure payment processing, intuitive navigation, and responsive design.
